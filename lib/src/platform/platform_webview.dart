///
/// This interface provides a unified API for interacting with WebViews across
/// different platforms (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and Web). Each platform
/// has its own concrete implementation that handles the platform-specific
/// details while exposing this consistent interface.
///
/// ### Platform Implementations
///
/// - **Android/iOS/macOS:** Uses `webview_flutter` via [FlutterWebViewController]
/// - **Windows:** Uses `webview_flutter_windows` (WebView2) via [WindowsWebViewController]
/// - **Web:** Uses an iframe with `dart:js_interop` via web-specific controller
///
/// ### Lifecycle
///
/// 1. Create the controller via [PlatformWebViewFactory.createController]
/// 2. Call [initialize] to set up the native WebView
/// 3. Call [enableJavaScript] and [addJavaScriptChannel] for communication
/// 4. Call [load] to load the Monaco editor HTML
/// 5. Use [runJavaScript] / [runJavaScriptReturningResult] for JS execution
/// 6. Call [dispose] when finished to release native resources
///
/// See also:
/// - [PlatformWebViewFactory] for creating platform-appropriate controllers.
/// - [MonacoController] which orchestrates this interface for the editor.

  /// Enables unrestricted JavaScript execution in the WebView.

  /// is enabled by default.

  ///
  /// Return-type behavior varies by platform:

  /// - iOS and macOS via WKWebView usually return native Dart values.
  /// - Android WebView may return JSON-encoded strings.
  /// - Windows WebView2 may return strings where numeric and boolean literals
  ///   remain strings after platform normalization.
  /// - Web iframe returns the result of JS interop conversion.
  ///
  /// `MonacoController.evaluateJavaScript<T>` normalizes these differences for
  /// JSON-serializable values. Prefer that method at the controller layer
  /// unless raw platform output is specifically required.
