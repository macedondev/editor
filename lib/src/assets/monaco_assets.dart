/// Manages Monaco Editor assets across all platforms.
///
/// This class is the single source of truth for Monaco asset locations,
/// versions, and extraction:
///
/// - **Asset extraction:** Copies bundled Monaco files to the app support
///   directory on native platforms for WebView access.
/// - **Version management:** Tracks the Monaco version and re-extracts on
///   updates.
/// - **Caching:** Avoids redundant extraction and HTML generation.
///
/// ### Platform Behavior
///
/// - **Native (Android/iOS/macOS/Windows):** Assets are extracted from the
///   app bundle to the application support directory on first use. A
///   sentinel file tracks the version to detect when re-extraction is
///   needed.
/// - **Web:** Assets are served directly from the `assets/` directory. No
///   extraction is needed.
///
/// ### Usage
///
/// ```dart
/// // Optional: warm up assets before creating the first editor.
/// await MonacoAssets.ensureReady();
/// ```
///
/// See also:
/// - `MonacoController.create`, which calls [ensureReady] automatically.
/// - [MonacoAssetDiagnostics] for the [assetInfo] shape.

  /// The Monaco Editor version bundled with this package.
  ///
  /// When this version changes, [ensureReady] will re-extract assets on
  /// native platforms to ensure the correct version is used.

  /// Ensures Monaco assets are extracted and ready for use on native
  /// platforms.
  ///
  /// This method performs the following checks and operations:
  ///
  /// 1. **Existence check:** Verifies `loader.js` exists in the target
  ///    directory
  /// 2. **Version check:** Compares sentinel file content with
  ///    [monacoVersion]
  /// 3. **Extraction:** Copies all assets from the bundle if missing or
  ///    outdated
  ///
  /// ### Thread Safety
  ///
  /// This method is idempotent and thread-safe. Multiple concurrent calls
  /// will share the same [Completer], ensuring extraction happens only
  /// once. Subsequent calls return immediately if assets are already ready.
  ///
  /// ### Web Platform
  ///
  /// On web, this method completes immediately without any file operations,
  /// as assets are served directly from the web server.
  ///
  /// ### Error Handling
  ///
  /// Throws [StateError] if asset extraction fails (e.g., insufficient disk
  /// space or permission issues). The error includes details about which
  /// files failed to copy.

  /// extracted from the app bundle to local storage (and any extraction
  /// error propagates, exactly as from [ensureReady]).
  ///
  /// On **web** it additionally warms the browser's HTTP cache with the
  /// files the boot will request - the AMD loader, `editor.main.js`/`.css`,
  /// and the hash-named editor chunk (~3.6MB) that dominates a cold first
  /// load. The warmup is best-effort and never throws: if any fetch fails,
  /// the boot simply downloads those files itself as usual. When several
  /// editors boot at once they all hit the warmed cache, so the bundle is
  /// downloaded once no matter how many editors mount.
  ///
  /// Call it early - fire-and-forget from `main()` is the intended use, so
  /// the download overlaps app startup instead of starting when the first
  /// editor mounts:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// void main() {
  ///   WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  ///   unawaited(MonacoAssets.precache());
  ///   runApp(const MyApp());
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// For web apps that want the warmup to start even before the Flutter
  /// engine downloads, see the "Web performance" section of the README for
  /// an equivalent `index.html` snippet.

  ///
  /// - **Corruption recovery:** If Monaco fails to load, clearing and

  ///
  /// On web, this method only clears the in-memory state since assets are
  /// served directly from the web server and cannot be deleted.
  ///

  /// invalid after clearing. Dispose and recreate them after calling this
